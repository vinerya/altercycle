# AlterCycle: Binary State Cyclic Data Structure

A specialized Python data structure for handling alternating binary states in cyclic sequences. Inspired by the MÃ¶bius strip's topology, AlterCycle excels at problems requiring strict state alternation and cyclic pattern analysis.

## Core Problem Domains

This data structure is specifically designed for problems where:

1. Binary State Alternation
   - States must strictly alternate (e.g., on/off, request/response)
   - Violations of alternation pattern indicate errors
   - State history needs to be maintained

2. Cyclic Pattern Analysis
   - Sequences form natural cycles
   - Patterns repeat with orientation awareness
   - Pattern detection must consider state alternation

## Proven Use Cases

### DNA Sequence Analysis
```python
from altercycle import AlterCycle

# Analyze DNA palindromes with natural complementarity handling
sequence = "GAATTC"  # Will detect palindrome considering A-T, C-G pairing
analyzer = DNAAnalyzer(sequence)
palindromes = analyzer.find_palindromes()
```

### Two-Phase Commit Protocol
```python
# Manage distributed transaction states with role alternation
protocol = TwoPhaseCommitProtocol()
protocol.add_message(Message(MessageType.PREPARE, "tx_1"))
protocol.validate_sequence("tx_1")  # Ensures proper coordinator/participant alternation
```

## Key Features

### Binary State Management
- **Strict Alternation**: Enforces alternating states (0/1) between adjacent nodes
- **Validation**: Automatically detects violations of alternation patterns
- **State History**: Maintains complete history of state transitions
- **Thread Safety**: Protected operations for concurrent state updates

### Pattern Analysis
- **Cyclic Detection**: Identifies recurring patterns in state sequences
- **Orientation Awareness**: Considers state direction in pattern matching
- **Palindrome Detection**: Specialized support for mirror patterns
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies breaks in expected alternation

## Ideal Use Cases

This data structure is specifically designed for and performs best in these scenarios:

### 1. Finite State Machines with Alternating States
Perfect for systems where:
- States must strictly alternate between two modes
- The sequence of states forms a cycle
- State history needs to be maintained
Example: Day/night cycle management in environmental control systems

### 2. Binary Signal Processing
Ideal for applications where:
- Signals alternate between two states
- Pattern detection must consider signal orientation
- Circular buffering is required
Example: Digital signal processing with alternating polarities

### 3. Two-Phase Protocol Implementation
Excellent fit for protocols where:
- Interactions follow a strict request/response pattern
- The sequence must maintain alternating roles
- Cycle detection is critical
Example: Network handshake protocols with role alternation

### 4. Biological Sequence Analysis
Particularly effective for:
- DNA strand complementarity analysis
- Protein folding patterns with alternating chirality
- Cyclic peptide sequence analysis
Example: Analyzing palindromic DNA sequences

## Limitations and Considerations

This data structure may not be the best choice when:
1. Data doesn't naturally alternate between states
2. Simple linear processing is sufficient
3. Memory overhead is a critical concern
4. Pattern detection doesn't need orientation awareness

## Installation

```bash
pip install altercycle
```

## Usage Examples

### Environmental Control System
```python
from altercycle import AlterCycle

# Create a day/night cycle controller
cycle = AlterCycle[str]()

# Add states with validation rules
cycle.append("DAY", {
    "temperature": 25,
    "lighting": "full",
    "next_valid_states": ["NIGHT"]
})
cycle.append("NIGHT", {
    "temperature": 18,
    "lighting": "off",
    "next_valid_states": ["DAY"]
})

# Validate transitions
assert cycle.validate_sequence()  # Ensures proper day/night alternation
```

### Network Protocol Implementation
```python
# Create a request/response protocol handler
protocol = AlterCycle[Message]()

# Add messages with role validation
protocol.append(Message("REQUEST", role="client"), {
    "requires_response": True,
    "timeout": 30
})
protocol.append(Message("RESPONSE", role="server"), {
    "completes_transaction": True
})

# Check for protocol violations
violations = protocol.detect_pattern_violations()
```

### DNA Analysis
```python
# Create a DNA sequence analyzer
dna = AlterCycle[str]()

# Add sequence with complementarity rules
for base in "GAATTC":
    dna.append(base, {
        "complement": COMPLEMENT[base],
        "position": len(dna)
    })

# Find palindromic sequences
palindromes = dna.find_palindromes(min_length=4)
```

## Advanced Features

### State Validation
```python
# Define state transition rules
def validate_transition(current, next):
    return current.orientation != next.orientation

# Create a validated sequence
sequence = AlterCycle[str](validator=validate_transition)
```

### Pattern Analysis
```python
# Find recurring state patterns
patterns = sequence.find_patterns(
    pattern_length=2,
    require_alternation=True
)
```
